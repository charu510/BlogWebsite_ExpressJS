# BlogWebsite_ExpressJS
This is a mini project including the various functionalities of ExpressJS.

It helped me reiterate through all that I had learned about the concepts of Express like making route connections and making
dynamic urls using the EJS templating.

Additionally, I also got introduced to the concepts of express routing parameters which was something new for me. Also as seen in the demo video, a preview
of the published article just consisting of 100 characters has been generated with an additional link to redirect to the post dedicated page. All this has been
achieved by harnessing the functionality and power of EJS templating.

A demo video of the same has been attached here:
